Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?
        React stateful components allow use of the component lifecycle including custom hooks and extending components from the parent class.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

        ComponentWillMount is called before the component is initially mounted, componentWillUpdate is called before the component is updated and then is rendered. 
3. Define stateful logic.
        Stateful logic is non-visual logic that manipulates state (data) within a component in order to implement seperation of concerns.

4. What are the three steps of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
        The three steps of creating a successful test are (Arrange); within the test render a React element into the DOM, (Act) then simulate a user action, and (Assert) lastly confirm expectations resulting from the user interaction.
